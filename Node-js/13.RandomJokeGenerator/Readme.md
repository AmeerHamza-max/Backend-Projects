# Random Joke Generator (Node.js CLI)

This is a simple command-line application built using pure Node.js. It fetches random jokes from a public API and displays them in the terminal.

No external packages are used â€” only built-in Node.js modules like `https` and `readline`.

## How It Works

1. Connects to the [Official Joke API](https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/).
2. Fetches a random joke (setup and punchline).
3. Prints the joke to the terminal.
4. Waits for user input:
   - Press Enter for another joke
   - Type `exit` to quit the app
